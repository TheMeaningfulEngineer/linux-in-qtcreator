# linux-in-qtcreator

# Motivation

I've always found that I miss a nice environment for experimenting with the Linux kernel so I can quickly jump 
to macro definitions or variable usages. Grepping from the shell on souch a big codebase demotivated me.
Than I saw [a talk](http://google.com) in which Linux as a project was imported into Qt Creator and Eclipse.
The purpose of this script is to simplify the steps for achieving this.
